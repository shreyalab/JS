# JavaScript Execution Context Notes

1.  **Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context.**

2.  **JavaScript is a single‑threaded, synchronous language.**

3.  **Execution context has 2 parts:**

    - **a. Memory Block (Variable Environment)**\
      Stores variables and functions.
    - **b. Code Block (Thread of Execution)**\
      Stores code and executes each line one after another, moving to
      the next only after the previous is completed.
